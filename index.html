                Hello there, my name is Cristobal Rocha, I'm from Mexico City and at the moment of creating this
                Portfolio I am 19 years old. With regards to my education I was lucky enough to attend school at the
                Edron Academy since I was 5 years old and entered kindergarden (2007), untill I was 16 years old and
                finished year 10 (2018), thanks to the education system and amazing teachers from abroad I was able to
                recieve a great level of education and because of it's small but loving comunity I was able to adopt
                important values into my life. <a href="https://www.edron.edu.mx/">The Edron Academy</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Edron Academy I went to study highschool at the TEC de Monterrey Santa Fe campus in Mexico
                City, the TEC de Monterrey is a big university and highschool that has close to 30 different campus
                across the country and is considered as one of the best schools in Mexico. At the start the change of
                school system and from a generation of 70 people to one with more than 700 people.

                        HTML-5 is a markup language most commonly used to create and present websites on the World Wide
                        Web, with it you are able to create and organize diferent aspects and parts of a website, for
                        example; a footer that contains the contact information, a form that allows the user to send a
                        meessage to the server, a table of content that displays different offers that the user can then
                        select, a navigation menu that allows the user to quickly find the different sections in a
                        website, and many other aspects that are necessary in a good website.

                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is normally used for changing and modifing the style
                        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML, an example would be the desing and the
                        aesthetics of a website can be modified using CSS. Another important aspect of CSS is that it
                        allows us to create a responsive website by changing and modifing the styling of the website
                        depending on the size of the device being used to view the website.

                    <p>
                        SCSS (or Sass) is basically an advance version of CSS but with more features that can make
                        coding much simpler, one of these features is mixins, mixins allow you to shorten some parts of
                        the code where instead of writing the same 4 or 5 lines of code over and over again in CSS you
                        can simply write those lines one time and after that you only need to insert 1 line in your code
                        whenever you need to apply that mixin, reducing the size of your code and the amount of work you
                        have to do.

                <div class="flexbox" id="flexbox">
                    <aside></aside>
                    <p>
                        Flexbox is used in CSS to arange the layout of elements within a container and is commonly used
                        on responsive websites because it makes designing and building responsive websites much simpler
                        by reducing or even removing the need for a lot of float and position properties in the CSS
                        code.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        A responsive website is one that changes and adapts depending on the size of the device that is
                        being used to see that website, for example the 3 most common versions that are taken into
                        consideration when developing a responsive website are the mobile version which normaly has a
                        minimum width of 300px, the tablet version usually has a minimum width of 700px and the desktop
                        versions ususally has a minimum width of 1000px.

                    I studied highschool at the TEC de Monterrey Santa Fe campus in Mexico
                    City, the TEC de Monterrey is a big university and highschool that has close to 30 different campus
                    across the country and is considered as one of the best schools in Mexico. Here I was able to
                    discover
                    my interest for coding and started with the simplified version where instead of lines of code we
                    would
                    select and put in order blocks that simbolized a form of code, like loop, print, values, etc...

                    At the moment of creating this portfolio I have almost completed the second module of the Web
                    development program in Tamwood and have learned a lot about coding and for now I have mostly learned
                    about coding with HTML-5, CSS and SCSS for web development as well as the basics of how information
                    travels, how servers work and the basics of web development.
